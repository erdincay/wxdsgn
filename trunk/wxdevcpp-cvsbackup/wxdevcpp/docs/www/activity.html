For the past weeks I've been working with Tony to fix some of the outstanding issues with the Beta 6.6 Installer. Finally the setup program is rock solid (say a big thanks to Tony - reina_ga AT hotmail DOT com for making this possible) and Hope everyone would enjoy the new release.
</P>

I havent touched the wx-devcpp code for the past 2 weeks. I'll be releasing the next beta 6.5  on Tuesday (12/07/2004). I'm hoping to investigate the merge of the current wx-devcpp code base to the updated dev-cpp codebase in the next few weeks. 
</P>

Lot of people are taking initiative to report bugs. Thank you all for submitting those bug reports. <br><br> I fixed couple of big show stoppers. The following are the bugs that are fixed today :<br>
1)There was a Code generation bug in the StaticBoxSizer.<br>
2)The Code generator for the wxHTMLWindow is adding a problematic code. <br>
3)Invisible Components are added as normal control. With the current fix, the Invisible components act as Delphi Like invisible components.<br>
4)Code Generation of  check Menu Item and Radio Menu Item had some problem.<br>
5)Changed the Template Loading function to use the Custom properties (Like Debug, Profile and Heuristic Compilation Options turned On by default)-This will fix the issue with program crashing intermittently when adding or removing controls.<br>
<br>
After getting enough reports about the 6.4 release, I'll release 6.5 beta by the end of this week.
</P>

Yesterday I got bunch of bug reports from couple of people (Rick being one among them). Most of the bugs are known issues. Since the external file change feature is not working properly, I made my own implementation of the the File size/create date change functionality. This feature will be a very useful feature when wx-devcpp is used just as a form designer with VC++ or other Major IDE. Julian Smart was asked me to fix this problem for him so that people can use DialogBlock as the main designer for wx-devcpp. I hope he will happy with this fix. There was also a bug in the wxHTMLWindow code generation. I fixed the issue and it will be in the next beta. I'll wait for couple of days and release a new version.
</P>

<h3>2004-11-07</h3>
<P>
Since there is a no major show stoppers found, I'm going to release the 6.4 beta final build to the public. <BR> Before doing the basic acceptance test before the release, I found couple of issues with the wxScrolledWindow Component. Also I fixed some issues pertaining to dialog designer. It seems the designer dialog is not resized with mouse; I had to tweak some form settings to bring it back to normal. If any of the beta tester find any problem , open the wxForm file and remove the line "BorderStyle = bsDialog". This should solve the problem.
</P>

<h3>2004-11-05</h3>
<P>
	Today Fixed a long standing bug pertaining to the Variable Rename of the Form.<br><br> The bug rate has reduced today and I guess I can able to release the program in couple of days. Lets hope the beta testers doesnt bring more bugs :o)<br>

	After spending lot of time watching the Presidential election coverage, I found some time to wrapup the final pre-beta release. 
	I was able to finish the wxMenuBar code generation and the Field Editor for the StatusBar. 
	<br>
	I packaged all the files and sent them to the beta testers. I hope I will get constructive feedback from them soon.
	<br>
	if you wish to test the pre-release beta, please send me an email <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=677339">gururamnath at users.sourceforge.net</A>.

	Finally the event Code Generator is completed.I have to convert the popUp Menu code to work with MenuBar. I guess it will take another day to ship the pre-release beta to the testers.

	<B>10.55pm:</B><br>
	I fixed a problem in the XPM generation code. Previously the generated images are not transperent but currently the images in button and other controls looks nice with the transperent ON.
	<br>
	I have also finished with the Bitmap Generation for the MenuItems in the PopupMenu.Once I finish the Event Generation Code, I can easily convert the Popup menu code to make it work for Menubar. After that I will release the program to the pre-release testers.
	<br><br>

	The Editor for PopUpMenu and Code Generation for Popupmenu (except for the event and Bitmap) is completed.

<P>
	I fixed more than 14 bugs in the list of 48 bugs I found yesterday. Most of the bug that are found yesterday requires some fundamental changes to the component code; I'm deferring those bugs for the next release. I'm still having problem implementing the Menu Editor. if you are a seasoned Delphi developers, let me know, I need your help in fixing some outstanding issues.
</P>

<h3>2004-10-29</h3>

<h3>2004-10-23</h3>
<P>
I accidentally deleted all the component files (yeah used Shift+Delete). This Amazing Freeware program called Restoration - <A HREF="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/restoration.html">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/restoration.html</A> came to rescue. In the process of recovery, I lost couple of files. More than 1 year of work is finally recovered.
