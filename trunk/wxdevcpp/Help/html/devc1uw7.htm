<P>It is a known fact that sometimes developers make errors when making a program. Those errors commonly called ‘bugs’ can be very tricky to find and correct, thus the debugger has been created to help developers investigate their program while it is running.</P>

<P>A debugger basically runs a program while keeping track of its functions, variables and instructions. It is capable of stopping your program at a given moment, which is called breakpointing. You can set breakpoints anywhere in your code : once your program reaches that code during execution, the debugger will stop and let you examine the current data in your program. </P>

<P>You probably already understand how useful a debugger may be when trying to correct bugs, so you may go to the<U> next section </U>ID_DEBUGPROCESS to learn how to use Dev-C++ integrated debugging.</P>
