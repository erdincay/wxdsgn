<P>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</P>

<P>Version 2, June 1991</P>

<P>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</P>

<P>675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA</P>

<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies </P>

<P>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>

<P>Preamble</P>

<P>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</P>

<P>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</P>

<P>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</P>

<P>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</P>

<P>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</P>

<P>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</P>

<P>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</P>

<P>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</P>

<P>your programs, too.</P>

<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</P>

<P>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</P>

<P>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</P>

<P>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</P>

<P>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</P>

<P>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</P>

<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</P>

<P>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</P>

<P>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</P>

<P>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>

<P>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</P>

<P>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</P>

<P>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</P>

<P>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</P>

<P>rights.</P>

<P>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</P>

<P>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</P>

<P>distribute and/or modify the software.</P>

<P>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</P>

<P>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</P>

<P>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</P>

<P>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</P>

<P>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</P>

<P>authors' reputations.</P>

<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</P>

<P>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</P>

<P>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</P>

<P>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</P>

<P>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</P>

<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</P>

<P>modification follow.</P>

<P>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</P>

<P>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</P>

<P>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</P>

<P>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</P>

<P>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,</P>

<P>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"</P>

<P>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</P>

<P>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</P>

<P>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</P>

<P>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</P>

<P>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".</P>

<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</P>

<P>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</P>

<P>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</P>

<P>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</P>

<P>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</P>

<P>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</P>

<P>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</P>

<P>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</P>

<P>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</P>

<P>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</P>

<P>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</P>

<P>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</P>

<P>along with the Program.</P>

<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</P>

<P>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</P>

<P>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</P>

<P>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</P>

<P>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</P>

<P>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>

<P>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</P>

<P>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</P>

<P>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</P>

<P>whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</P>

<P>part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</P>

<P>parties under the terms of this License.</P>

<P>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</P>

<P>when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</P>

<P>interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</P>

<P>announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</P>

<P>notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</P>

<P>a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</P>

<P>these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</P>

<P>License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</P>

<P>does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</P>

<P>the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</P>

<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</P>

<P>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</P>

<P>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</P>

<P>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</P>

<P>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</P>

<P>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</P>

<P>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</P>

<P>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</P>

<P>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</P>

<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</P>

<P>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</P>

<P>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</P>

<P>collective works based on the Program.</P>

<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</P>

<P>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</P>

<P>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</P>

<P>the scope of this License.</P>

<P>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</P>

<P>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</P>

<P>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</P>

<P>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</P>

<P>source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</P>

<P>1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>

<P>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</P>

<P>years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</P>

<P>cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</P>

<P>machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</P>

<P>distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</P>

<P>customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>

<P>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</P>

<P>to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</P>

<P>allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</P>

<P>received the program in object code or executable form with such</P>

<P>an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</P>

<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</P>

<P>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</P>

<P>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</P>

<P>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</P>

<P>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</P>

<P>special exception, the source code distributed need not include</P>

<P>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</P>

<P>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</P>

<P>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</P>

<P>itself accompanies the executable.</P>

<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</P>

<P>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</P>

<P>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</P>

<P>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</P>

<P>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</P>

<P>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</P>

<P>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</P>

<P>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</P>

<P>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</P>

<P>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</P>

<P>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</P>

<P>parties remain in full compliance.</P>

<P>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</P>

<P>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</P>

<P>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</P>

<P>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</P>

<P>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</P>

<P>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</P>

<P>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</P>

<P>the Program or works based on it.</P>

<P>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</P>

<P>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</P>

<P>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</P>

<P>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</P>

<P>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</P>

<P>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</P>

<P>this License.</P>

<P>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</P>

<P>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</P>

<P>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</P>

<P>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</P>

<P>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</P>

<P>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</P>

<P>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</P>

<P>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</P>

<P>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</P>

<P>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</P>

<P>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</P>

<P>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</P>

<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</P>

<P>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</P>

<P>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</P>

<P>circumstances.</P>

<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</P>

<P>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</P>

<P>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</P>

<P>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</P>

<P>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</P>

<P>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</P>

<P>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</P>

<P>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</P>

<P>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</P>

<P>impose that choice.</P>

<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</P>

<P>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</P>

<P>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</P>

<P>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</P>

<P>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</P>

<P>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</P>

<P>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</P>

<P>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</P>

<P>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</P>

<P>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</P>

<P>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</P>

<P>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</P>

<P>address new problems or concerns.</P>

<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</P>

<P>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any</P>

<P>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions</P>

<P>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</P>

<P>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</P>

<P>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</P>

<P>Foundation.</P>

<P>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</P>

<P>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</P>

<P>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</P>

<P>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</P>

<P>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</P>

<P>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</P>

<P>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</P>

<P>NO WARRANTY</P>

<P>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</P>

<P>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</P>

<P>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</P>

<P>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</P>

<P>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</P>

<P>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</P>

<P>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</P>

<P>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</P>

<P>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>

<P>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</P>

<P>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</P>

<P>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</P>

<P>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</P>

<P>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</P>

<P>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</P>

<P>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</P>

<P>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</P>

<P>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>

<P>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>

<P>Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</P>

<P>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</P>

<P>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</P>

<P>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</P>

<P>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</P>

<P>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</P>

<P>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</P>

<P>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</P>

<P>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</P>

<P>Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;</P>

<P>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</P>

<P>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</P>

<P>the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</P>

<P>(at your option) any later version.</P>

<P>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</P>

<P>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</P>

<P>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</P>

<P>GNU General Public License for more details.</P>

<P>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</P>

<P>along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software</P>

<P>Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.</P>

<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</P>

<P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this</P>

<P>when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>

<P>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author</P>

<P>Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.</P>

<P>This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it</P>

<P>under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</P>

<P>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate</P>

<P>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may</P>

<P>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be</P>

<P>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</P>

<P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</P>

<P>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if</P>

<P>necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</P>

<P>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program</P>

<P>`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</P>

<P>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989</P>

<P>Ty Coon, President of Vice</P>

<P>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into</P>

<P>proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may</P>

<P>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the</P>

<P>library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General</P>

<P>Public License instead of this License. </P>
