<P><A NAME="topic27"></A><SUP></SUP>Making and using Templates </P>

<P>Dev-C++ can create and manage template files. Those templates contains information for creating automatically specific projects of your own. Dev-C++ contains 5 default projects, but it lets you design your own too with templates.</P>

<P>Making templates:</P>

<P>To create a new template, click on the File menu and then on “New template file”.</P>

<P>This will bring you the Template Builder, which creates and registers template files in Dev-C++. </P>

<P>Template Information: </P>

<P>Enter the name, description and category of your template. You can also select an icon, which will be used by the executable generated after compiling a template project.</P>

<P><B>Editor information:</B>Here you can set the cursor position that will be set when creating a template file. For example, if your templates contains the following default code:</P>

<P>int main()</P>

<P>{</P>

<P></P>

<P>}</P>

<P>you should put the following cursor position : </P>

<P>Column = 4 (like for a TAB)</P>

<P>Row = 3 (points to the third line, where the text is empty).</P>

<P>You need to set cursor position for C and C++ codes.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Project information:</P>

<P>This is for setting the default options your template will generate for a project. They are the same as in Project Options.</P>

<P>Code: </P>

<P>Type in the text fields the default C/C++ codes that will be used when creating a project from your template. Default code can be for example:</P>

<P>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</P>

<P>int main()</P>

<P>{</P>

<P></P>

<P>}</P>

<P>When you are ready to save and add your file to the Template list, click on the Save button, and type a filename in the dialog box that follows.</P>

<P>Using templates:</P>

<P>Creating a project from your template is the same as for creating usual projects. Click on the File menu in Dev-C++, then on “New Project…”. On the following dialog, click on the “Custom Templates” tab sheet, this will bring you the list of available templates to create a project from. Select a template and press the OK button (or double-click on the selected icon), and a new project will be created using the default options and code as you wrote in your template.</P>

<P>Deleting templates:</P>

<P>In the New Project dialog, select the template you are willing to delete and press the DEL (delete) button on your keyboard.</P>
