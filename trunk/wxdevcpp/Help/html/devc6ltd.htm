<P>Bloodshed Software is a non-profit organization devoted to serve programmers and internet users by providing them free softwares and free internet services.</P>

<P>About Dev-C++:</P>

<P>Dev-C++ is a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE), which is able to create Windows (GUI, console, DLLs...) C/C++ programs using the Mingw compiler system or theorically any GCC based compiler.</P>

<P>About MinGW:</P>

<P>MinGW is a collection of header files and import libraries that allow one to use GCC and produce native Windows32 programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party DLLs. The current set of tools include GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Binary Utilities (Binutils), GNU debugger (Gdb) , GNU make, and a assorted other utilities. We are currently working on creating a complete set of Mingw-hosted GNU toolchain, and looking for volunteers. </P>

<P>At the basic level, MinGW is a set of include files and import libraries that allow a console-mode program to use Microsoft's standard C runtime library MSVCRT.DLL (available on all NT systems, and on all stock Win9x after the original Windows 95 release (for which it can be installed separately). Using this basic runtime, you can write console-mode ANSI compliant programs using GCC and use some of the extensions offered by MS C runtime, but cannot use the features provided by the Windows32 API. The next critical piece is the w32api package, which is a set of includes and import libraries to enable the use of Windows32 API, and combined with the basic runtime, you (potentially) have full access to both the C Runtime (CRT) and Windows32 API functionality. Please see the licensing information on the various pieces. </P>

<P>See here for information on how Mingw differs from Red Hat/Cygnus Cygwin and AT&amp;T UWIN.</P>

<P>If you see any errors on this help file, please contact either Kip, or Colin.</P>
