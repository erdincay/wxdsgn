<P>Now we are going to compile the project, and create a Windows executable.</P>

<P>Click on the Execute menu, and click on "Compile". A dialog will ask you where do you want to save your file. Select a directory as well as a filename for your file and click on Save. A windows titled "Please wait while compiling..." will appear. Dev-C++ is currently compiling the file. If you don't get any compile errors, you can click on the Execute button to launch the executable of your program.</P>

<P>If any error occurs, it will be displayed in the Compiler output panel (at the bottom of Dev-C++). You can then double-click on it to go to the error in your source.</P>
