<P>Launching your program into the debugger is easy. Just go to the <I>Debug</I> menu and click on <I>Debug</I>  <IMG SRC="../images/icon_debug.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> (shortcut : F8).</P>

<P>If you do not have debugging information set in your project, Dev-C++ will ask you if you want to rebuild your program with these information enabled. You can manually select that option in Compiler Option in the Linker section. After your project has been rebuild, you can launch Debug again. </P>

<P>The debugger has now loaded your program and runs it. but until that you can learn to control several aspects of the debugger :</P>

<P>The output Dev-C++ receives from GDB is displayed in the <I>Debug Output</I> sheet at the bottom of Dev-C++.</P>

<P>This output is probably only interesting if you are familiar with GDB. You can also send commands directly to it (if you do not know GDB, you can type the <I>help</I> command for to have a list) by using the edit box just above the output (see screenshot below).</P>
