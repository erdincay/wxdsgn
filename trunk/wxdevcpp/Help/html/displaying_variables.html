<h1>Watching variables</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most interesting
aspects of debugging
is the possibility to display the value of your variables at a given
time. This way you can be sure your variable (e.g. a counter index) has
the value you would expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wxDev-C++ is able to
conveniently show you&nbsp;the contents of your
classes, strings, structures/unions, arrays and other variables in the
<em>Debug</em> <em>Local Variables</em> window:</p>
<p><img src="../images/debug_browser.gif" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p>Note that in the above window, <code>iTesta</code>
has already had its value set to "5", but <code>iTestb</code>
has not been set (the value will be&nbsp;random and depends on what
data is at that pointer at that given time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now keep this <em>Local Variables</em>
window open and re-start the debugging. &nbsp;You should be able to
"step through" the code after the breakpoint (discussed in the <a href="stepping_debug.html">last section</a>) and watch
the <code>iTesta</code> variable change from a random
value to "5".</p>
<h4>Adding Watchpoints</h4>
<p>Watchpoints
are like breakpoints that are triggered not by a particular line of
code, but by the change in value of a particular variable in code.
&nbsp;For example, let's say that you've got a large program and
think
that your variable <code>iCount</code> is being changed
unexpectedly.
&nbsp;You can set a regular breakpoint (at any line number), run
the
debugger to the breakpoint, and then add a watch to <code>iCount</code>.
&nbsp;The debugger will then always break whenever the value of <code>iCount</code>
changes.</p>
<p>To set a watchpoint, add a normal breakpoint to your code and
run the debugger. On the <em>Debug</em> window, click on
the <strong>Watch</strong> tab. Then, click anywhere
within the <strong>Watch</strong> tab space. An <i>Add
Watch&nbsp;</i>
(shortcut : <strong>F4</strong>) menu should appear.</p>
<p><img src="../images/icon_addwatch.gif" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p>Once you select <em>Add Watch</em>, a dialog box
should appear:</p>
<p><img style="width: 312px; height: 210px;" alt="Watch variable" src="../images/debug_watchvariable.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the name of your variable
in the dialog,
and press OK. If you select a word in the current source file and press
<strong>F4</strong>, it will add a watch of the selected
text without asking for a
variable name. A breakpoint can be generated when the value of the
variable is written, read, or both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once a watchpoint variable is set, it will continue to be monitored in
future debugging runs. You can also modify the value of your watched
variable at any time during debugging by right clicking on the variable
name in the <em>Debug Watch</em> window and selecting <em>Modify</em>
value.
Note that you are changing this value outside of your source code. The
next time you run the debug, the value you entered is lost and the
program executes normally.</p>
<h2>Important Notes: </h2>
<ul>
<li>When using pointers to structures or classes, if you want
to display all the members of variable <i>my_pointer </i>then
you need to watch <i>*my_pointer</i> (&#8216;*&#8217; is the
value-operator). Watching only <i>my_pointer</i> would
just display the address contained in <i>my_pointer</i>.</li>
<li>Sometimes the debugger may not know the type of a pointer,
and
cannot display all of the members of the pointed structure or class.
You can bypass this problem by casting your watched variable. For
example, if the debugger cannot show the contents of <i>my_pointer</i>
of type MyPointer, you could try adding the watch variable: <i>*(MyPointer
*)my_pointer</i></li>
</ul>
