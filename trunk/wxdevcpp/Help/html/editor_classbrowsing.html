The Class Browser is a hierarchical tree that displays all of the
classes, functions, global variables, and structures that are used in
your project. It's a nice way to graphically display the major players
in your programs. The <em>Class Browser</em> is displayed
in the <em>Project Inspector</em> window under the <strong>Classes</strong>
tab. <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong style="color: red;">NOTE: Class browsing MUST BE ENABLED to
use the wxDev-C++ visual designer.</strong><br>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>Engine options</strong>
section, you can configure the class browser to scan both local and
global include files for their major players. &nbsp;If you chose to
scan for global include files, then you will also include in the class
browser the classes and functions from the 3rd party libraries you link
with your program (e.g. wxWidgets libraries, SQLite libraries, etc.).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>View</strong>
options section, checking the <strong>Show inherited members</strong>
box will cause the class browser to also display any classes from which
your classes are dervied. For example, if you create your own wxFrame
class called myFrame1, the browser windowwould typically only show the
members of that class that you've specified in your project. With the <strong>Show
inherited members</strong> checked it will also display the
members that were inherited from the generic wxFrame class.<br>
