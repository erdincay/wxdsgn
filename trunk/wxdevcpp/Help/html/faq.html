<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<h2>wxDev-C++ FAQ</h2>
Please note that we have a robust <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewforum.php?f=28">wxforum</a>
where someone has probably asked your question already. &nbsp;We
also have several online <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/?q=node/6">tutorials</a>
that are a great help to the beginner. Finally, SofT has written a book
called <a href="http://wxdevcpp-book.sourceforge.net/">"Programming
with wxDev-C++</a>".<br>
<br>
If you have web access, please consult our <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/?q=node/2">online FAQ</a>.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>What is wxDev-C++?</li>
</ul>
<br>
wxDev-C++ is an extension of Dev-C++ with a Form Designer for the
amazing cross-platform framework <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>.
It contains all the features of Dev-C++ alongside a recent wxWidgets
distribution along with a form desinger for rapid application
development (RAD).<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Where can I get help for wxDev-C++?</li>
</ul>

You can either see the available <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/?q=node/6">tutorials</a>
or post your question in the <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewforum.php?f=28">wxForum</a>.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Which language is wxDev-C++ written in?</li>
</ul>

wxDev-C++ and Dev-C++ were written with Borland Delphi 6.0 Personal
Edition, a free (albeit closed-source) compiler for Windows (yes, the
irony). Lots of open-sourced, third party components like the JVCL and
extlib are used.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Where do I obtain the wxDev-C++ source code?</li>
</ul>

Have a look at our <a href="http://wxdsgn.svn.sourceforge.net/wxdsgn/">Subversion
repository</a>. You can download the source by clicking on the "Download GNU tarball" link.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Will there be a release for Linux?</li>
</ul>

You will have to ask this question to the core Dev-C++ developers.
Since wxDev-C++ is based on Dev-C++, a Linux distribution will be a
possible only if we have a Linux version of Dev-C++. Some effort (by
Tony) have been put in to compile wxDev-C++ with Lazarus failed.
Nuklear Zelph has managed to get wxDev-C++ running under Wine on the
latest version of Ubuntu linux. You may wish to contact Nuklear on the <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewforum.php?f=28">wxforum</a>
if you want to find out how to do this. <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Why does wxDev-C++ take a long time to compile, and the
binaries produced so large?</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because MingW gcc tries to
emit code that will work on many platforms, it tends to be <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=2772&amp;highlight=slow">slow
at
compiling programs</a>. Using the MS VC compiler may speed up
compilation and produce (slightly) smaller binaries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=736&amp;highlight=huge+executable">Large
binaries</a> are produced because of static linkage with
libstdc++
(which is said to be bulky) and the static, monolithic build of
wxWidgets that we include in wxDev-C++. Dynamic linkage to wxWidgets
can be done if desired
(see the <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/?q=node/9">tutorial</a>
on building your own wxWidgets library), and
switching to STLport is advised if you need to reduce the binary size. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people assume that large binaries
are a sign of waste and inefficiency. This may be true. However,
remember that GUI programs are necessarily large due to the intensive
use of graphics (even if you don't take advantage of all that the
graphics can do).&nbsp;It's&nbsp;unlikely you'll produce a
useful GUI for under 100 Kb or even under 1 Mb (even for a "Hello
World!" program). So you can build you own wxWidgets library as a DLL
that just includes wxTextCtrl and wxButton, BUT it's not going to be a
very useful library for your other programs (which may need more
components).<br>

<h2>Dev-C++ FAQ</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: This part of the
FAQ is a holdover from Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 and may no longer be up-to-date
or relevant.</span><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Why can't I use conio.h functions like clrsrc()?</li>
</ul>

Because conio.h is not part of the C standard. It is a Borland
extension, and works only with Borland compilers (and perhaps some
other commercial compilers). Dev-C++ uses GCC, the GNU Compiler
Collection, as its compiler. GCC is originally a UNIX compiler, and
aims for portability and standards-compliance.<br>
<br>
If you really canot live without them, you can use Borland functions
this way:<br>
Include conio.h to your source, and add the following file to your
project : C:\Dev-C++\include\conio.c (where C:\Dev-C++ is where you
installed Dev-C++).<br>
<br>
Please note that conio support is not complete.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>My console window keeps closing, how do I change that ?</li>
</ul>
<br>
You can do it this way:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 383px; height: 182px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
<br>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; printf ("Press ENTER to continue...\n");<br>
&nbsp; getchar (); /* wait for input */<br>
&nbsp; return EXIT_SUCCESS;<br>
}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<ul>
<li>After linking, i get an error like
<strong>C:\DEV-C++\LIB\\libmingw32.a(main.o)(.text+0x8e):
undefined reference
to `WinMain@16'</strong></li>
</ul>

You probably haven't declared any main() or WinMain() function in your
program.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How can i provide a .def file for my DLL ?</li>
</ul>

Go to the <em>Project </em>menu and select<em>
Project Options</em>, <em>Parameters</em> sheet, <strong>Linker</strong>
box . Add to the textbox, --def
yourfile.def<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>I am having strange problems under Windows XP</li>
</ul>

Try to run Windows Update and make sure that you have the Program
Compatibility updates.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How do I enable Debugging mode ?</li>
</ul>

Go to the <em>Project </em>menu and select<em></em>&nbsp;<em>Project
Options</em> and click on the <em>Compiler</em>
sheet. In the <strong>Linker</strong>
section, put &#8220;Yes&#8221; to 'Generate debugging information'. Do a 'Rebuild
All' and you should be able to debug now.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>When I launch Dev-C++ I get the message saying
'WININET.DLL' or
'MSCVRT.DLL' or &#8216;SHFOLDER.DLL&#8217; not found</li>
</ul>

You are missing a Windows DLL (and probably have a broken version of
Windows). Please go to the Microsoft Update site and see if you can fix
your installation of Windows.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How to use assembly with Dev-C++ ?</li>
</ul>

The "GNU as" assembler uses AT&amp;T syntax (not Intel).<br>
Here's an example of such a syntax :<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 387px; height: 352px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>// 2 global variables<br>
int AdrIO;<br>
static char ValIO;<br>
<br>
void MyFunction(..........)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __asm("mov _AdrIO, %dx") ; // loading 16
bits register<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __asm("mov _ValIO, %al") ; // loading 8
bits register<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't forget the underscore _ before
each global variable names !<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; */<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __asm("mov %ax,%dx") ; // AX --&gt;
DX<br>
}</code>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<ul>
<li>I am using Windows 98 and I cannot compile</li>
</ul>

Some users have report that you need to apply several patches to your
system. Here is the list of them, they can be found on Microsoft
Windows 98 download site.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 47569us.exe - labeled as Windows98SE
shutdown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * dcom98.exe - see also this page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * DX81eng.exe - latest version of
DirectX (this is 11MB, and cannot be uninstalled without reinstalling
Windows 98. You might want to try this one last in case the other above
didn't work, as it should update many parts of the system).
