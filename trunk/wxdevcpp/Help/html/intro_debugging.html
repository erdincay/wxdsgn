<h1><b>Introduction to debugging</b></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All developers make mistakes,
but some mistakes
are harder to detect than others. Compile-time mistakes are usually the
easiest to spot because wxDev-C++ will provide a list of those errors
(including line numbers and suggested corrections) in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Compiler Output</span>
window. Runtime errors (or "bugs") are more insidious because the
developer has no way of knowing what line of code caused the dreaded
infinite loop or "<code>Access Violation</code>" or "<code>Segmentation
Fault</code>" or "<code>Blue Screen of Death</code>".
Thus debuggers were&nbsp;created to help developers
investigate their program while it is running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A debugger is a program that
runs your program
inside of it. It keeps track of your program's
functions, variables and instructions. It is capable of pausing your
program at a given moment (aka breakpointing), allowing you to view
(and even modify) the values of your variables at that moment, and then
continuing the execution of the program either one instruction at a
time (stepping) or to the end of execution. You can set
breakpoints anywhere in your code : once your program reaches
that&nbsp; code at runtime, the debugger will pause your program
and
let you examine its variables at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tutorial explains the use
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">MingW
GNU debugger</a> (gdb). It can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> be
used with the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MingW gcc
compiler</a>. Note that gdb is intended to be a command-line
interface. It runs as
its own shell allowing the user to run gcc-compiled programs from
within that shell. All we do in wxDev-C++ is send messages to the gdb
shell and parse the output as it occurs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With gdb (as with all
debuggers), we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>specify places within the program to halt execution (aka
breakpoints)</li>
<li>step through the program one line of source code at a time</li>
<li>view the values of variables in realtime as the program
executes</li>
<li>evaluate the memory stack when a program throws an error</li>
</ul>

<h5>Note that a web search will reveal many gdb tutorials
out there
that are far better than this one in terms of scope (for example, <a href="http://dirac.org/linux/gdb/">http://dirac.org/linux/gdb/</a>).
Please consider review them if you really want to learn the in's and
out's of using gdb.</h5>

<h5>There are, in fact, other graphical programs, which
also use gdb in a similar manner. For instance, the Data Display
Debugger (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd">ddd</a>)
is a popular GUI interface for gdb debugging. You may, in fact, prefer
to
use these 3rd party programs instead of the built in wxDev-C++
interface.</h5>
