<p >Visual C++ 2003 is a
versatile Development environment for wxWidgets. I’m
going to outline the way it can be used with wx-devcpp. The main idea is to add
the .wxForm extension files to the VC++ Projects and then
make the wx-devcpp available to VC++ when we click the .wxForm
file in the File Manager.</p>

<p> 1) Create a wx-devcpp Project in a desired Directory.</p>
<p> 2) Create an empty Visual C++ project and add all the Files that are associated with the wx-devcpp project.</p>
<p> 3) Add the corresponding wx Libs/Include file path in the VC++’s Lib/Include Directories.</p>
<p> 4) Add all the .wxForm Files that are created along with the wx-devcpp project. (Make sure you add the .wxForm files if you are creating a wxDialog or wxFrame class externally). </p>

<p> 5) Select any of the .wxForm file and Right Click. Then Choose the menu item “Open With”. </p>

<p> 6)     In the “Open With” Dialog, Click the Add Button and select the wx-devcpp executable (typically c:\dev-cpp\devcpp.exe)  and assign a Name for the Executable as (wx-devcpp or anything of your choice).</p>

<p> 7)     Highlight the added wx-devcpp program entry and click the “Set as Default” and then click the “Open” button.</p>

<p> After you make modifications to the wxForm, corresponding .Cpp and .H will be updated; so when you close the designer, the VC++ 2003 will ask whether you want to reload the changed .CPP and .H contents. Accept yes and proceed editing the code.</p>

<p> <B>Note :</B><br>

It’s a good practice to create a Project Folder specifically for the .wxForm files and have them organized there(Right Click in the Project Browser-> Add -> New Folder) . When you create a wxForm folder, be sure to add “wxForm; ” in the Folder’s Filter property. This will allow the “Add Existing Files” Menu item to automatically put the .wxForm files to the previously created directory.
